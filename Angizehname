<h2 style="font-family:Andalus;text-align:center;">IN THE NAME OF GOD</h2>
 <h3 style="font-family:Andalus;text-align:center;">my statement of purpose</h3>
<span style="font-size:30pt">I</span> want to apply for the UedM the montral university is located in montral.the popular city at canda states.
that offers more than 650 undergraduate and graduate courses to students.
<h3 style="font-family:Andalus;text-align:center;">my aim and stimulant</h3>
Iam a computer engineer wants to improve,develop and increase her ability and skill of advance programming 
about elaborating operational softwares and websites for peoples daily use and speacialy petrochemical factories and atlast robots technologies...
I think that I can make and develop some wonderfull and practical softwares and big websites with being educated in this univercity.
<h3 style="font-family:Andalus;text-align:center;">about myself</h3>
I have had a lot of research on computer,programming and designing dynamic and static websites.
and finally I could be able to master half of the web and software topics
such as:<span style="font-weight:bold">C++,html,css,php,Java,wordpress,seo</span> in two years
.and within a year I designed 3 websites called "googlesun,myshop and afzooneha".
that the first one is a big web designer site can make all of the websites such as:
personal site,corporate site,containing news site,medical and ... just in a week with the best speed and attractive graphic.
<br />the second site is the big painting shop and the last one is the big plugin market with the pro version of them.
<br />I taught in on of the  capital's language institution for a year.
so for the sake of it I didn't have any problem about the computer and programming.
and I could research so many topics about computer on Internet in English easily.
and I could easily use the knowledge of American and english professors in the field of 
computers on google and Youtube and so on.
<br />I was doing all these things while a wave of lessons,exams,etc was coming toward me from the university!
that was so hard but my intense interest in computers and programming made me not get bored and stop trying and stydying.
<h3 style="font-family:Andalus;text-align:center;">work experience</h3>
During the design of my 3 sites I encountered many problems that 
somtimes took days to solve the problem and I asked for help from many professors in this field.
I searched on the enternet most of the times so that I had get friend with almost all of the keywords of google in the field computer!
for making these 3 websites ,the second one,myshop I designed it with the content
managment system,wordpress but I changed its default theme with php ,html and css.
but two others site was maked with php,html,css,... .
most of the time I write novels and sycology books in persian and in english.so my writing is good 
both in english and persian.so beacuse of this I can programming easily and so fast!and present for people in the shortest time.
<h3 style="font-family:Andalus;text-align:center;">my goals</h3>
I hope so,god willing,after being accepted in this university,i can try more than before and learn others programming languages and develop and improve my abilities.
and after finishing the graduating I hope so to recruit in the best company.this is my last goal!
